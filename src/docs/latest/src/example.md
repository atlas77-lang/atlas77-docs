List of all of the keywords in the language:
- class
- struct
- enum
- concept
- package
- import
- fun
- let
- const (both for `&const T` and `const t: T`, one is constant reference type and the other is constant variable)
- new
- delete
- if/else/while/for
- return
- break/continue
- operator
- extern
- public/private
- as (for casting)
- comptime (for compile-time evaluation)

- uint8/uint16/uint32/uint64
- float32/float64
- bool

> Primitive types are considered as keywords, but I do plan to change that, because it risks to bloat the keyword list.
