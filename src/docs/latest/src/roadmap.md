# Atlas 77 Language Roadmap

## Current Version

Atlas 77 is currently in **early development** (v0.7.1). The compiler and runtime are functional but not production-ready. Expect breaking changes and API modifications.

## Atlas77 Roadmap Update
> [!NOTE]
> This roadmap is subject to change as development progresses. The focus areas and features listed are planned but may evolve based on community feedback and technical considerations.
> It also only talks about the future of Atlas77.

### v0.7.x *Covenant*
> Already released
This is the next major milestone and is actively being worked on.

**Focus areas**:
* Introduction of **move/copy semantics** to enable safer code and automatic scope cleanup
* Rework of the `_copy` constructor semantics
* Expansion and stabilization of parts of the standard library
* Introduction of `memcpy<T>(&T) -> T` for explicit shallow copies
* Addition of a **HIR pretty printer** to inspect the output of the compiler after the last HIR pass.

#### Planned v0.7.x breakdown (subject to change)
To give more visibility into the expected progression of the v0.7 series, the current intent is roughly:

##### v0.7.0
- Initial release based on the current ownership and move/copy work
- Content largely matching what is present in the current PR:
  https://github.com/atlas77-lang/atlas77/pull/141

##### v0.7.1
> Already released
- Complete rework of the `_copy` constructor semantics
- Introduction of `std::copyable` and `std::non_copyable` flags on structs to make copy behavior explicit
> Similar to how Rust does `#[derive(Copy)]` to make a struct copyable. In Atlas77 it will be a bit different, `std::copyable` will force a struct to be copyable (if possible) but you don't have to add `std::copyable` for a struct to be copyable by default, it just forces the compiler to try. `std::non_copyable` will prevent a struct from being copyable even if all its fields are copyable.

##### v0.7.2
> Currently in development
- Introduction of constraints on methods of generic structs, based on the generic parameters of the struct  
  > Example: `Vector<T>.foo()` may only exist if `T` satisfies `std::copyable`

#### Other planned v0.7.x features (not strictly tied to a specific sub-release)
- Compiler recover from certain errors and continue processing to provide more complete diagnostics
- Improvements to error messages and diagnostics
---

### v0.8.x
This release will focus on **runtime and execution model changes**, including:
* Reworking the VM from **stack-based to register-based**
* Moving toward a **typed VM**
* Improving the heap with more realistic allocation behavior

> v0.7 and v0.8 are the only releases that are currently clearly scoped and planned in this order.

---

### Beyond v0.8.x
> Everything after v0.8 is **not set in stone**, both in scope and in scheduling. These are directions rather than commitments:

* v0.9.x: package system improvements, namespacing (`std::foo::bar`), larger std, package manager
* v0.10.x: optimization passes (DCE, constant folding, inlining, loop unrolling, etc.), likely introduced incrementally
* v0.11.x: higher-level language features (operator overloading, traits/interfaces, generic methods, constraints)
* v1.0.x: undecided; possibly bootstrapping, possibly something else entirely
