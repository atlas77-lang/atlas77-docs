# Introduction

Welcome to *The Atlas77 Programming Language*, an experimental book about the Atlas77 programming language. Experimental because I'm trying to gather and lay down my thoughts about the language as I develop it to normalize the language in itself. It could be compared to how C++ has its own version (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, etc.) with each having thousands of page of documentation to formalize the language.

Atlas77 is a statically typed, compiled programming language that I do in my free time.
I hope to be able to use it for future projects. Don't expect it to be production-ready anytime soon.

# Goals

- Having a `core/graphics` module that links to Vulkan/OpenGL/DirectX.
- Having a `core/sdl` module that links to SDL.
- Bootstrapping the compiler.
- Having a `core/ffi` module that allows interfacing with C libraries.
- Having a `core/ffi` module that allows interfacing with Rust libraries.
- Making a game with it.
- Linking to [blue_engine](https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngine)
- It should work üòÅ
