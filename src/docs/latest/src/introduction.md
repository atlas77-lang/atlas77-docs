# Introduction

Atlas77 is a statically typed, compiled programming language that I do in my free time.
I hope to be able to use it for future projects. Don't expect it to be production-ready anytime soon.

# Goals

- Having a `core/graphics` module that links to Vulkan/OpenGL/DirectX.
- Having a `core/sdl` module that links to SDL.
- Bootstrapping the compiler.
- Having a `core/ffi` module that allows interfacing with C libraries.
- Having a `core/ffi` module that allows interfacing with Rust libraries.
- Making a game with it.
- Linking to [blue_engine](https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngine)
- It should work üòÅ
